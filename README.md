# Stochastic Simulation Platform for Assessing Safety Performance of Autonomous Vehicles in Winter Seasons

## Project Overview
This multidisciplinary research project aims to contribute improved algorithms in simulation and fundamental knowledge in computing to build an advanced cyberinfrastructure toolkit. The project focuses on producing a stochastic simulation platform that can evaluate the capabilities of AVs' automated driving systems. The motivation is to produce a reliable tool that can model stochastic vehicle behaviors, study vehicle dynamics, and predict potential AV safety risks under adverse driving conditions in winter.

### Key Objectives
1. Leverage the physics principles of a microscopic traffic model to regularize the machine learning process for simulating vehicle interactions.
2. Predict both multi-vehicle and single-vehicle crash probabilities in mixed traffic by integrating the traffic simulation model with a new vehicle dynamics model.
3. Assess AV safety performance on icy/snowy pavement by studying stochastic vehicle motions.
4. Integrate the models into an open-source software package with comprehensive documentation and multiple application cases.

The expected deliverable will be a public cloud-based platform that is easy to access and capable of incorporating new data streams for model improvement. After validating the models with field data, the project will connect the simulations with existing automated driving systems for testing. This project can have broad impacts on other science and engineering fields such as physics-supported artificial intelligence, smart and autonomous systems, and other research domains that depend on simulated data.

## Snowy Vehicle Trajectory Data
The snowy dataset was collected by the team at the I-695 highway segment in Baltimore, Maryland, United States on 01/15/2024 using a drone. A total of 50 minutes of video footage was captured in 4K resolution at 30 frames per second and subsequently processed into vehicle trajectory data.
