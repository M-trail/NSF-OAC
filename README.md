# Non-parametric stochastic fundamental diagram model considering empirical/physics prior
In the Zip file GP.zip, we conduct codes that train non-parametric stochastic fundamental models. Several well-known single-regime fundamental diagram models are calibrated and taken as the mean function of our proposed non-parametric regression model; the calibration code is also included in this repository. The 2D and 3D representations of the proposed stochastic fundamental models are attached.
# Weighted-least-square-method-for-single-regime-fundamental-diagram-models
In the Zip file WLSM-New.zip, we conduct codes reproduce the weighted least square method presented in "On the fundamental diagram for freeway traffic: A novel calibration approach for single-regime models.", which helps us to calibrate empirical/physics fundamental diagram models so that those calibrated models can be used as the prior. The calibrated models are also attached.
