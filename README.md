# Project Overview

This multidisciplinary research project aims to develop an advanced cyberinfrastructure toolkit that significantly improves algorithms in simulation and enhances fundamental knowledge in computing. The focus of the project is to create a stochastic simulation platform capable of thoroughly evaluating the capabilities of Autonomous Vehicles' (AVs) Automated Driving Systems (ADS), especially under adverse winter driving conditions.

The motivation behind this research is to build a reliable tool that can accurately model stochastic vehicle behaviors, study vehicle dynamics, and predict potential AV safety risks when faced with icy or snowy road conditions. This is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of AVs before widespread implementation.

## Key Objectives

- **Physics-Regularized Modeling**: Leverage the principles of physics through a Physics Regularized Gaussian Process (PRGP) model to enhance the machine learning process used for simulating vehicle interactions on icy/snowy roads.
  
- **Crash Risk Prediction**: Predict both multi-vehicle and single-vehicle crash probabilities in mixed traffic environments by integrating the traffic simulation model with a new vehicle dynamics model, accounting for the complexities of winter driving conditions.
  
- **Safety Assessment**: Conduct comprehensive safety assessments of AV performance on icy and snowy pavement by analyzing stochastic vehicle motions and the corresponding risk factors.

## Research Thrusts

To overcome the challenges associated with assessing AV safety in winter driving conditions, the project will focus on the following research thrusts:

- **Thrust 1: Stochastic Simulation with Vehicle Behavioral Modeling**  
  Using vehicle trajectories and pavement ice/snow patterns obtained from roadside videos as the training dataset, a novel microscopic model will be designed to simulate Human Vehicle (HV) behaviors on icy/snowy roads using the **Physics Regularized Gaussian Process (PRGP)** technique.

- **Thrust 2: AV Safety Assessment with Vehicle Dynamic Modeling**  
  By studying vehicle dynamic factors that affect AVs' safety performance on slippery roads, an efficient, reliable, and accurate model will be developed to predict the crash risks of AVs in a mixed HV-AV environment under adverse driving conditions.

- **Thrust 3: Platform Development with Incremental Online Learning**  
  The models and algorithms will be integrated into an open-source software package, with comprehensive documentation and numerous application cases. The expected deliverable is a public cloud-based service that is easy to access and capable of adopting new data streams from users for ongoing model improvement.

- **Thrust 4: Validation and Transition-to-Practice Plan**  
  Validation will first be conducted using field data collected in Utah. The transition-to-practice plan includes:  
  1. Connecting the platform to the existing federal cyberinfrastructure, CARMA, to ensure research sustainability.  
  2. Testing the simulation platform with the operating autonomous shuttles of the CARS Lab at Wayne State University.  
  3. Deploying this simulation platform to AV testbeds for broader application.

## Broader Impacts

The expected outcomes of this project include a public cloud-based simulation platform that not only facilitates the assessment of AV safety in winter conditions but also serves as a valuable resource for the broader AV research community. By validating the models with real-world data and integrating them with existing automated driving systems, this project aims to ensure the practical applicability and sustainability of the developed toolkit.

Additionally, this research has the potential to impact other scientific and engineering fields, such as physics-supported artificial intelligence, smart and autonomous systems, and any research domain that relies on simulated data for critical evaluations.

## Car-following Simulation Using Real-world Data
### Snowy Vehicle Trajectory Data
Real-world snowy dataset was collected by the team at the I-695 highway segment in Baltimore, Maryland, United States on 01/15/2024 using a drone. A total of 50 minutes of video footage was captured in 4K resolution at 30 frames per second and subsequently processed into vehicle trajectory data. Dataset could be found [here](https://github.com/M-trail/NSF_OAC/tree/main/Data).

### Car-following Model Calibration

The Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) is a widely used car-following model in traffic flow theory. The IDM can be expressed mathematically as:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\frac{dv_{n}}{dt}=a[1-(\frac{v_{n}}{v_{0}})^{\delta}-(\frac{s^{*}(v_{n},\Delta%20v_{n})}{s_{n}})^2]" alt="IDM Equation" />
</p>

In this model, the free acceleration term, $$a\left[1 - \left(\frac{v_{n}}{v_{0}}\right)^{\delta}\right]$$, governs the vehicle’s acceleration. Here, $$a$$ represents the maximum possible acceleration, and $$v_{0}$$ denotes the desired speed of the vehicle. When the road ahead is clear, a stationary vehicle accelerates at the rate of $$a$$, with this rate gradually decreasing as the vehicle’s speed increases. The reduction in acceleration is controlled by the exponent $$\delta$$, ensuring that the vehicle does not exceed its desired speed. Following the IDM author's recommendation, $$\delta$$ is typically set to 4.

Calibration of a car-following model like the IDM involves selecting an appropriate optimization algorithm, a goodness-of-fit (GoF) function, and a measure of performance (MoP). One of the most effective algorithms for calibrating such models is the Genetic Algorithm (GA). This heuristic, nonlinear optimization technique, inspired by the principles of natural selection, has proven to be both robust and efficient for calibrating a wide range of car-following models.

The combination of MoP and GoF plays a crucial role in the success of the calibration process. In this example, we utilize the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of spacing as the performance metric, which can be computed as follows:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?RMSE(s)%20=%20\sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t%20=%201}^{T}[s_{i}(t)%20-%20\widetilde{s}_{i}(t)]^{2}}" alt="RMSE Equation" />
</p>

To ensure that the calibrated IDM parameters remain within realistic and practical bounds, the following constraints are applied:

- The time gap $$T$$ is restricted to the range of $$[0.1, 3]$$ seconds.
- The minimum spacing $$s_0$$ is set between $$[1, 5]$$ meters.
- The maximum acceleration $$a$$ is limited to $$[0.1, 4]$$ m/s², which corresponds to an acceleration rate allowing a vehicle to reach 100 km/h in approximately 6 seconds.
- The comfortable deceleration is capped at $$[0.1, 9]$$ m/s².
- The upper bound for the desired velocity $$v_0$$ is set at 33.6 m/s (120 km/h).

It is essential to note that the lower limit for $$v_0$$ should exceed the highest observed velocity in the dataset. This detail is often overlooked in other studies but is crucial, as exceeding $$v_0$$ in real-world conditions can lead to an exaggerated deceleration due to the power term $$(\frac{v_{n}}{v_{0}})^4$$. This factor underlines that $$v_0$$ in the IDM is primarily intended to model acceleration, not deceleration scenarios.

In this example, the GA calibration parameters are set as follows:

- The algorithm runs for a maximum of $$200$$ generations, with each generation comprising a population of $$100$$ individuals.
- The mutation rate is set at $$0.05$$.
- To balance computational intensity with model accuracy, a sampling rate of $$0.2$$ seconds is employed, which has been deemed sufficient for calibrating the car-following model.
