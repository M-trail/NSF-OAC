SUMO-CARLA Co-Simulation
========================

The SUMO-CARLA co-simulation framework combines the traffic flow simulation capabilities of SUMO with the high-fidelity autonomous driving simulation provided by CARLA. This co-simulation allows for a comprehensive evaluation of autonomous vehicle (AV) behavior in various traffic scenarios.

Co-Simulation Overview
-----------------------

- **Cross-Scale Simulation**: SUMO handles large-scale traffic flow simulations, while CARLA provides detailed, localized simulations of individual vehicles.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: SUMO and CARLA exchange data in real-time, allowing vehicle behaviors and traffic conditions to dynamically influence each other.
- **Integration for AV Testing**: By leveraging both tools, researchers can simulate complex scenarios involving mixed traffic environments and adverse weather conditions.

Key Advantages
--------------

- **Scalability**: Handle large-scale traffic networks with detailed AV behavior simulations.
- **Flexibility**: Customize scenarios to test specific AV algorithms or behaviors under varied conditions.
- **Realism**: Combine the strengths of both SUMO and CARLA for more realistic simulations.

Use Cases
---------

- **Autonomous Vehicle Development**: Test and validate AV algorithms in diverse traffic conditions.
- **Traffic Flow Analysis**: Study the impact of AVs on overall traffic flow and optimize accordingly.
- **Safety Assessments**: Evaluate AV safety performance in complex and adverse driving conditions.
