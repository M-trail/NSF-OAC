SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility)
===================================

SUMO is an open-source, microscopic traffic simulation tool that allows for simulating and modeling transportation systems. SUMO supports the simulation of traffic lights, public transport, pedestrians, and other modes of transportation in large-scale networks.

Key Features
------------

- **Traffic Simulation**: Capable of simulating entire cities, including complex traffic scenarios and interactions.
- **Vehicle Behavior Modeling**: Models vehicle dynamics, including acceleration, deceleration, lane changes, and more.
- **Multi-Modal Simulation**: Supports a wide range of transportation modes such as private cars, buses, bicycles, and pedestrians.
- **Extensible and Open-Source**: Users can extend SUMO with custom models and integrate it with other tools.

Use Cases
---------

- **Urban Traffic Planning**: Used for evaluating traffic management strategies, public transport systems, and infrastructure planning.
- **Research and Development**: Commonly used in academic and industrial research for traffic modeling and simulations.
- **Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Testing**: Supports the simulation of connected vehicle environments.
